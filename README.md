**🔌 IoT Basics with Arduino & ESP8266**
This repository contains beginner-friendly IoT projects using Arduino, ESP8266, and various sensors. These projects cover basic IoT principles, sensor integration, and WiFi-based control.

**🛠 Arduino IDE Installation & Online Alternatives**

1️⃣ Install Arduino IDE (Offline)

🔹 For Windows:
Download from Arduino Official Site.
Run the installer and follow the setup.
Install USB drivers if prompted.

🔹 For macOS & Linux:
Download the Mac/Linux version from Arduino Official Site.
Extract and install the software.

2️⃣ Online Alternatives (No Installation Needed)
🚀 If you don’t want to install Arduino IDE, use these online platforms:

✅ Arduino Web Editor (Official & cloud-based)

✅ TinkerCAD Circuits (Simulate circuits & write code)

✅ Wokwi Simulator (Advanced simulation for Arduino, ESP32, etc.)

These platforms allow you to write, test, and simulate Arduino code online!

**🔧 Requirements**
Arduino IDE for coding and uploading sketches.

ESP8266/NodeMCU libraries for WiFi-based projects.

DHT11 & PIR Sensor libraries (install via Arduino Library Manager).
