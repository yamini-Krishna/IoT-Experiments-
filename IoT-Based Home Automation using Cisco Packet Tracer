This project simulates a home automation system where you can control lights, fans, and a door lock remotely using a mobile device connected to a WiFi router. The setup uses Arduino, IoT devices, and an IoT Cloud server inside Cisco Packet Tracer.

🔧 Components Needed in Cisco Packet Tracer
Arduino Uno – Main controller for IoT devices
IoT Smart Light – Turns ON/OFF via mobile app
IoT Smart Fan – Turns ON automatically based on temperature
IoT Door Lock – Lock/unlock via mobile app
Temperature Sensor – Reads temperature to control the fan
Home WiFi Router – Connects Arduino & IoT devices to the network
Tablet PC (Mobile App Simulation) – Controls IoT devices
IoT Cloud Server – Enables remote control from the mobile

📡 Step-by-Step Setup in Cisco Packet Tracer

1️⃣ Connect the Arduino to the WiFi Router
Click on Arduino Uno, go to the Programming Tab, and connect Serial0 to the WiFi Router.
Assign an IP address to the Arduino so it can communicate over the network.

2️⃣ Add IoT Devices & Connect to the Router
Place IoT Smart Light, Fan, and Door Lock from the IoT Devices section.
Go to each device's Settings and connect them to the WiFi Router using SSID & password.

3️⃣ Add the IoT Cloud Server
Drag an IoT Cloud Server into the workspace.
Connect the WiFi Router to the IoT Cloud using Ethernet.
Register the IoT devices in the IoT Cloud Server so they can be controlled remotely.

4️⃣ Add a Tablet (Mobile Device) for Control
Drag a Tablet PC from the End Devices section.
Connect it to the WiFi Router by selecting the correct SSID.
Open the IoT Monitor App inside the Tablet.
Pair the IoT devices (Light, Fan, Door Lock) with the app.

CODE:

int lightPin = 2;
int fanPin = 3;
int doorLock = 4;
int tempSensor = A0;

void setup() {
  pinMode(lightPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(fanPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(doorLock, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  int temp = analogRead(tempSensor);

  // Auto Fan Control
  if (temp > 30) {
    digitalWrite(fanPin, HIGH);  // Turn ON fan if temperature > 30°C
  } else {
    digitalWrite(fanPin, LOW);   // Turn OFF fan if temperature is normal
  }

  // Remote commands from Mobile App
  if (Serial.available()) {
    char command = Serial.read();
    
    if (command == 'L') { digitalWrite(lightPin, HIGH); }  // Turn ON Light
    if (command == 'l') { digitalWrite(lightPin, LOW); }   // Turn OFF Light
    if (command == 'D') { digitalWrite(doorLock, HIGH); }  // Unlock Door
    if (command == 'd') { digitalWrite(doorLock, LOW); }   // Lock Door
  }
}

📱 How to Control Devices from Mobile (Tablet PC in Cisco Packet Tracer)
Open the Tablet PC.
Go to Desktop → IoT Monitor App.
Pair the Smart Light, Fan, and Door Lock.
Use the ON/OFF buttons in the app to control the devices remotely.
📌 Example Controls:

Press "L" → Light turns ON
Press "l" → Light turns OFF
Press "D" → Door Unlocks
Press "d" → Door Locks
